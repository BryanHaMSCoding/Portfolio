                    <p>Hello! My name is Bryan Ha, and I am a Fullstack Developer with a unique journey from healthcare to technology. I began my career as a dialysis technician, gaining a deep understanding of patient care and healthcare systems. Alongside this role, I earned a degree in Healthcare Management, which provided me with valuable insights into healthcare administration.</p>
                    <p>Leveraging my healthcare background, I plan on specializing in building robust web applications using C#, HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript to improve patient outcomes and streamline processes. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology and healthcare, making a meaningful impact through my technical expertise and industry experience. I strive to develop applications that truly benefit patients and healthcare providers alike.</p>

                    <h2>Projects</h2>
                    <h3>Uncharted Waters</h3>
                    <img src="./porfolio pic/Sub data level function.png" alt="uncharted water picture">
                    <p>Uncharted Waters is a naval strategy simulation project developed using C#. It leverages 3D satellite data to model the distribution and density of submarines—both friendly and enemy—across surface, underwater, and deep water levels. The project showcases my ability to handle complex multidimensional arrays, implement sophisticated conditional logic, and design an intuitive console-based user interface. Through this simulation, users can make strategic decisions based on submarine densities and ratios, determining the best course of action for naval engagements.</p>
                    <h3>Bloom Landing Page</h3>
                    <img src="./porfolio pic/blooming-page.jpg" alt="bloom landing page project">
                    <p>I recreated this webpage from a template, demonstrating my ability to implement and customize pre-existing designs. This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, as I tailored the layout, styling, and responsive elements to match the original template's design. Through this exercise, I enhanced my understanding of web development best practices and the importance of clean, maintainable code.</p>
                    <h3>Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
                    <p>This portfolio project highlights my skills in web development, showcasing my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to create a visually appealing and responsive design, manage content layout, and ensure cross-device compatibility. The portfolio includes sections that detail my background in healthcare, my journey into software development, and my completed projects, such as "Uncharted Waters," a naval strategy simulation using C#. This project underscores my capability to integrate design and functionality, reflecting my commitment to producing high-quality, user-centric web applications.</p>
